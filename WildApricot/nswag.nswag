Keep this in mind.\n  \n          Limitations:\n            - Maximum size for one uploaded picture is 10mb.\n            - Maximum request length is 10mb.

Bmp pictures will be converted to png format.\n            - Time period after uploading when picture would be available for use is 30 minutes.\n            - Each uploaded picture can be used only once. After first usage it will be removed permanently.\n            - Mime type must be 'image' and must correlate to picture type. If you upload the 'png' with 'image/bmp' mime type set, this picture will be dropped.\n            - In case of uploading several pictures in one request either 'Name' or 'FileName' property of Content-Disposition header must be set. Otherwise the picture will be dropped.\n  \n        consumes:\n          - multipart/form-data\n  \n        parameters:\n          - $ref: '#/parameters/accountId'\n  \n          - name: picture0\n            in: formData\n            description: The uploaded picture0 data\n            type: file\n            required: true\n  \n          -
